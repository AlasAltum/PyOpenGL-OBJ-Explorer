# PyOpenGL-OBJ-Explorer
PyOpenGL OBJ Explorer is inspired to let you explore buildings as OBJ files made with programms like SketchUp or Rhino.


## How to use

Just go to the directory where you cloned this repo and type in the console, using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute building_explorer.py file, you will be asked if you want to use texxtures or just fill surfaces with colors.
Then write the file of an obj file in the same directory, for example. kirby (it can be either kirby or kirby.obj)
If you said that you want to use textures, then you will be asked which texture to reproduce in the whole obj file.

You can walk through your obj file using WASD and your mouse like in a first person game, and can make the obj bigger or smaller by pressing O and P.

Thanks to Daniel Calder√≥n and Pablo Pizarro for their contributions to the lib files.
